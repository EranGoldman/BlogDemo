# Demo Page

Welcome to our demo page! This page demonstrates how standalone pages work in Jekyll.

## About This Page

This is a static page that exists outside of the blog post chronology. Pages are perfect for content that doesn't change frequently, such as:

- About pages
- Contact information
- Project documentation
- Team information

## Getting Started

To create your own pages, simply add a new Markdown file with front matter at the top. The `permalink` field in the front matter determines the URL where this page will be accessible.

## Resources

Here are some helpful resources for working with Jekyll:

- [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
